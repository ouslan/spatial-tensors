\section{Introduction}



\section{Background and Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide background information and context of the research problem.
	\item What is the research scope?
	\item What is the question or problem you are trying to answer or solve?
	\item Why is this important?
	\item How is it done today, and what are the current limitations and challenges?
\end{itemize}

\section{Systematic Literature Review}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the state of the art in this area of research?
	\item Provide proper references.
	\item It is recommended that PRISMA guidelines be followed (\url{https://www.prisma-statement.org/}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Aims and Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are you trying to accomplish?
	\item How are you going to do the work?
	\item What is new in your approach? How is your approach going to be different from others?

The classic Spatial regressions are an extension of the normal regresion with with the addition of a spatialy term.
\begin{equation}
	y = \alpha + X \beta + \rho W X + \epsilon
	\label{eq:SDM}
\end{equation}

This spatial can be addapted spatialy control for either your dependent term
\begin{equation}
	y = \alpha + X \beta + \rho W Y + \epsilon
	\label{eq:SAR}
\end{equation}

Or even the error term

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		y & =\alpha + X \beta + u  \\
		u & =\gamma W u + \epsilon
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:SEM}
\end{equation}

\section{Prototype Design and Implementation}
Design a preliminary prototype to solve parts of the proposed problem (e.g., simple code using Python).

\section{Success and Impact}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you know that you successfully achieved your project goals? What is the expected output of the project?
	\item Explain what the resulting success of the project would be and what impact could be achieved if the funding is awarded.
	\item In alignment with Vision 2030.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Who can benefit from the project's output? How are you going to reach them?
		      \item Provide a draft ‘plan for the dissemination and exploitation of the project's results’.
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
