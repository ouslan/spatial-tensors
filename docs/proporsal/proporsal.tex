\section{Research Plan and Methodology}

Starting for a simple regression of ordinary least squares (OLS) can be defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
	y_i = \alpha + \sum^p_{i=1} x_i \beta_i + \epsilon
	\label{eq:OLS}
\end{equation}
where $y$ is our expicatory variable and $x$ is the independent variables. If we wanted to study the corrolation that a location $i$ has on its neighbors, the classic approach would be
to define a relationship matrix $W$ which details how each location relates to all other locations. This classic Spatial regressions are an extension of the normal regresion with with
the addition of a spatialy term, which can be defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
	y = X \beta + \rho W X + \epsilon
	\label{eq:SDM}
\end{equation}

expanding the matrixes we get the following:
\begin{equation}
	y_{it} = \alpha + \sum^p_{i=1} x_{it} \beta_i + \rho \sum^N_{j=1} w_{ij} x_{jt} +\epsilon
	\label{eq:SDM_exp}
\end{equation}

This spatial can be addapted spatialy control for either your dependent term
\begin{equation}
	y = \alpha + X \beta + \rho W Y + \epsilon
	\label{eq:SAR}
\end{equation}

Or even the error term

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		y & =\alpha + X \beta + u  \\
		u & =\gamma W u + \epsilon
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:SEM}
\end{equation}

Continuing from the SDM we can express the model a non linear equation as follows:
\begin{equation}
	y = \alpha + \sum^p_{i=1} x_{it} \beta_i + f(C_i) + \epsilon
	\label{eq:tensor}
\end{equation}
where $C$ is the centroid of the observations and $f(C)$ is a function given the centroid of the individuals.



The overall hypothesis is whether the semiparametric methode preforms better
on average given that we do not have reason to believe what is $W$. We expect to find what are to mesure the effects of picking a wrong $W$
and wheather we can miticate them with using a spetial smoother.

\section{Prototype Design and Implementation}

The Strategy for this resarch is to simulate data in the folowing format:
\begin{equation}
	y \sim \alpha + \sum^p_{i=1} x_{it} \beta_i + \rho \sum^N_{j=1} w_{ij} x_{jt} + \epsilon
\end{equation}

Where $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2$ and $W$ is defined in multiple ways this could be show in the following examples:

\section{Success and Impact}

The SDM generaly carries the problem that is very influenced on how $W$ is defined and there is now systematic
methedology to pick an apropiet $W$. This task is mostly delegated to domain experties. Given that the semiparametric
model proposed does not depend on $W$ this research intends to look if this model has a better preformance than the SDM model.
Preformance of this model is primarly defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\sum_{n=1}^N(y_n-\hat{y}_{nSDM})^2}{N}; \quad \frac{(y-\hat{y}_{GAM})^2}{N}
	\label{eq:pref}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of simulations, $y$ is the predetermine outcome variable that we picked before the simulations are run.
In addition we would also use look at the performance of $\beta$ which can be shown in the simal maner:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{(\beta-\hat{\beta}_{SDM})^2}{N}; \quad \frac{(\beta-\hat{\beta}_{GAM})^2}{N}
	\label{eq:pref2}
\end{equation}
